# toric-code-neural-decoder

The corresponding preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06640.
A very brief description of toric code can be found [here](https://xiaotongni.github.io/2018/11/16/classical-description-toric-code/). It's mainly for people without a background of quantum information.

A script for 2 basic examples can be running on
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l3q35FFoxzPRNs_MMxD1FQJean5OwLsA
  1. Evaluating a trained model for d=16 toric code
  2. Training of the dense layers and global training for d=64 toric code
(you can choose to use GPU on Google Colab)

Checkpoint for d=64 with strict training policy: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AnrDSycv-SnyumJ--xsv7BplMjCo8zMY
Checkpoint for d=64 with more training: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zCaKb7oxe0oHw1HcJjP0q_OShE_ZD44r
Can be loaded similarly to the Google Colab script.
