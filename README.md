(you can choose to use GPU on Google Colab)
It's updated to include a script for training L=64 decoder.

Checkpoint for d=64 with strict training policy: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AnrDSycv-SnyumJ--xsv7BplMjCo8zMY
Checkpoint for d=64 with more training: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zCaKb7oxe0oHw1HcJjP0q_OShE_ZD44r
Can be loaded similarly to the Google Colab script.

Not very familiar with license, will add one later. (Currently on holiday)
